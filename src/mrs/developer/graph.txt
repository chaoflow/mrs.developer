mrsd graph
==========

The mrsd graph command creates a dependency graph of the package in your
src/ directory. It uses pygraphviz / graphviz.


Installing / requirements:
--------------------------

You need to have pygraphviz installed in the python installation you are
running mrsd with. Pygraphviz requires a graphviz installation. These
depedencies are not automatically installed when installing mrs.developer.


Installing graphviz:

Graphviz is a open source graph visualization software. You can either
install it with your favourite package manager (brew, port, nix, apt,
etc) or you download it from the website:
http://www.graphviz.org/


Installing pygraphviz:

Even tough pygraphviz is listed on pypi, the installation with easy_install
may not work. It's recommended to download it either from pypi or from
their website and install it by running "python setup.py install". But
you may need to change the setup.py manually and uncomment the section
where the path to the graphviz library is defined.
You'll find further information on the project website:

Usage
-----

Make shure that you have rootet mrs.developer in your buildout (using
`mrsd init` or by adding it as buildout extension). Also keep in mind
that the graph primary contains all eggs from your src directory
(which is "${mrsd-root}/src"), because it is too heavy to render the
graph when using frameworks such as zope and plone.

Now you can just run it:

.. code-block:: console

    % mrsd graph


There are some options such as changing the output filename or generating
a graphviz .dot-file. Check the help for all options:

.. code-block:: console

    % mrsd graph --help


It's also possible to tell mrsd graph which dependencies should be followed
and added to graph:

The default way is that all packages from the src directory are taken and
only dependencies between theese packages are listed. Dependencies to other
packages, which are not in the src directory are not listed, neither theese
packages.

When using `mrsd graph --follow` the dependencies from the packages in the
src directory to other "third-party" packages are listed. Theese third-party
packages are listed too, but their dependencies are not listed.

When using `mrsd graph --recursive` the dependencies of third-party packages
are listed too and followed. The dependencies are then followed to the end.
This option may cause very heavy graphs and graphviz may have some minutes
to render it.
