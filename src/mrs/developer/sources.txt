Sources and Packages and Eggs
=============================

Terminology
-----------

Based on to http://guide.python-distribute.org/.

A Source is the source for packages:

    - directory on the filesystem (``~.buildout/eggs/``, ``./eggs/``)
    - pypi (``http://pypi.python.org/simple``)

A package has releases.

A release contains zero or one source distributions and zero or more binary
distributions.

A distribution is versioned.

A distribution contains zero or more python packages.

A binary distribution is created from a source distribution.

A binary egg is a binary distribution and vice versa.

A development egg is a source distribution and vice versa.



Within a source an egg is uniquly identified by its name.
One egg can have multiple versions.

    >>> buildout_cache = Source('~/.buildout/eggs')
    >>> zcb = buildout_cache['zc.buildout'] 
    >>> zcb.versions


    >>> pypi = Source('https://pypi.python.org/simple')
    >>> package = pypi['zc.buildout']
    >>> package.keys()
    ['1.1', '1.2', '1.3a']
    >>> release = package['1.1']
    >>> release.keys()
    ['sdist', '2.4', '2.6']
    >>> sdist = release['sdist']
