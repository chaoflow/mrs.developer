mrsd reload
===========

The mrsd reload command reloads triggers `plone.reload`'s view for relading
code without restarting Zope.

Usage / requirements:

- `plone.reload` is added to egg-section of your instance-part:
- `mrs.developer` is added to buildout.cfg as extension

Example buildout.cfg:
..

    [buildout]
    parts =
        instance2
    extensions =
        mrs.developer

    [instance1]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = myadmin:pass
    eggs =
        Plone
        plone.reload


    [instance2]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = myadmin:pass
    eggs =
        Plone
        plone.reload


For reloading the code just run `mrsd reload` from somewhere within your
buildout folder:


.. code-block:: console

    % ./bin/mrsd reload


When buildout is run mrs.developer remembers which parts are configured.
The instance part configuration is used by `mrsd reload` for guessing
host, port, admin-username and -password.

The default values are taken from the first instance-part defined in your
buildout configuration. Following recipe types for instance parts are
supported:

- `collective.recipe.zope2cluster`
- `plone.recipe.zope2instance`

It's also possible to select another instance to reload:

.. code-block:: console

    % ./bin/mrsd reload --instance instance2


By using arguments it's also possible to change the configuration used:

.. code-block:: console

    % ./bin/mrsd reload --instance instance2 --pass=very-secret
