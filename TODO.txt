- per interpreter develop?
- per interpreter customize?
- change into customized eggs dir
- hooks to be executed after changing into customized egg directory
  (e.g.: git l; git s)
- plone.reload support

- figure out what commands need a config and which can run unrooted
- loaded config has only absolute paths, paths are relativated on save

- keep order of entrypoints for cmds

- nodify the mrsd.cmdset, they take and return nodes, mrsd serializes nodes
  into json

- find-links for cloned distributions?

- consistent naming of doc files .txt vs .rst, all our txt are in rst format.
  it is kind of common to use .txt even if it is in rst format.
